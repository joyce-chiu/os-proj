OS Project

The project is a simulation of an operating system. Your program works together with an existing
program (SOS) that simulates a job stream. SOS feeds your program a series of jobs and job requests;
like a real operating system, your program must field those requests and handle the life cycle of each of
the jobs, from system entry to termination.
